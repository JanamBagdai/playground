This repository contains a small Kotlin server that can be used to support a generic container-based playground backend, allowing untrusted code in any language to be safely executed.
The goal is to support interactive online code examples in a variety of programming languages.

An [online demo is available](https://cs124-illinois.github.io/playground/).
